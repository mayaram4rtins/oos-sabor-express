# :page_facing_up: Project Description

This repository contains the codes built regarding the classes from Alura concerning Oriented-Object Programming. Is these classes, I was able to learn about classes, how to use "__name__ == '__main__'", how the __pycache__ folder works and by the end of the course a little bit of fastAPI and virtual environment was taught!
